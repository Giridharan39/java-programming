                Wash and soak the 4 cups of Idli rice and one cup of black urad dal for about 7 - 8hours. Soak a tsp of fenugreek seeds in a small bowl for 2 hours.
                Step 2
                                
                Clean the wet grinder and add the washed dal along with fenugreek seeds. Grind dal for half an hour by sprinkling water to it. It will raise up much more than the deskinned urad dal.
                Step 3
                                
                Remove from grinder and follow with washed Idli rice. Ground until they are in a smooth consistency.

                Mix the dal and rice batter together along with salt. Let it rest to ferment for 8 hours or overnight.
                Step 5
                                
                Heat a dosa pan and spread a ladle of the batter in a circular motion. Drizzle with gingelly oil and allow it to cook.
                Step 6

                Step 1
                If you are using homemade yogurt, drain them on to a muslin cloth and hang them to drain off water content in it. After about 30 mins, you can find a thick cheese-like curd collected in the muslin cloth. This is hung curd.
                Step 2
                In a bowl add the hung curd, G&G paste, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander, and garam masala powder. Sprinkle salt and mix them thoroughly. Add Paneer cubes to it for marination and set them aside for about 30 mins minimum to even overnight in the refrigerator.
                Step 3
                I marinated for about an hour. After this, heat a dosa pan and drizzle oil all over. Gently place each of the marinated cubes to the Tawa. Flip over after 2 mins and cook until done. Set aside.
                Preparing the Tikka Masala gravy
                Step 4
                Fine chop onions and tomatoes. Heat a pan and add oil to it. Once they shimmer, add jeera seeds, followed by onions. Saute them until they turn pink. Add a spoon of ginger-garlic paste, until the raw smell goes off.
                Step 5
                Add tomatoes to it and saute till they are cooked. Add the tomato puree to it and keep stirring. To this gravy add all the masala powders – Coriander, Red chili, Garam Masala powder, and a cup of water.
                Step 6
                Keep the flame low and cook for about 6 mins until the oil is separated from it. Add salt to it and mix. Transfer the grilled paneer cubes to it and combine them together.

                Keep mixing continuously to avoid lumps. This is the tricky part of this Kesari. It becomes hard to break the lumps if it is formed.
                Step 5
                While stirring the Rava/sooji, add orange food color to it. Once the Rava is cooked in 5 – 7 mins, slowly add sugar. Keep stirring the rava while doing this as it might form lumps again.
                Step 6
                The Kesari will become sticky soon after sugar is added. Start adding ghee in slow quantity and keep stirring until the desired consistency is obtained.
                Step 7
                Before switching off the stove, add cardamom powder and garnish with roasted cashews and raisins. Serve hot or warm. This is a fool-proof recipe and can be easily made by anyone.

                Step 2
                In a mixer, finely grind 2 tbsp of roasted gram dal(Pori kadalai/ Pottu kadalai). This will fetch around 4 tbsp of roasted gram dal powder. Sieve the grounded powder and add 2 tbsp of this to the rice+gram flour mix.

                In a cookie sheet, line up bread without touching each other. Drizzle olive oil to the bread and apply pizza sauce generously over the bread.
                Step 3
                Now top off with Onions and bell peppers generously. Sprinkle salt, pepper over the toppings. Make sure to check your pizza sauce for salt. If it already has salt in it, avoid adding salt again.
                Step 4
                Top off with a generous amount of cheese and finish off with mixed herbs. Place it in the oven and bake for 15 mins and additionally broil for 5 mins if you like the cheese to change color.
